# Image Format and Insertion Explanation

Due to time constraints, I was unable to choose a better image format or insert images into the non-dynamic content of the project. 

## Image Format

Choosing an optimal image format can significantly impact the loading time and user experience of a website. However, due to time limitations, I could not explore or implement the most appropriate format for each image, such as using WebP for better compression or AVIF for improved quality.

## Insertion of Images

Another aspect I was unable to address was inserting images into the non-dynamic content of the website. Images should be properly integrated into the page to ensure they are responsive, load efficiently, and contribute to the page's overall performance. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this was not possible in the current iteration.

I plan to revisit this and make improvements once there is more time available for refining these aspects of the website's design and functionality.
